# Task 1:
The first thing that comes to mind is a transport system, from planning bus intervals  to designing bus lines, building new routs in connection with extending metro routes and development of new city districts. It is absolutely clear that firstly it should be simulated, because of dramatic economic consequences of any unsuccessful real-live experiment. For example, when planning bus routes, it is necessary to ensure that all schools in the district are covered by bus lines, while also taking into account that the school day for most pupils starts at 8:15- 9:00 . From the perspective of sustainability, routes and intervals can be planned to minimize fuel consumption.

# Task 2:

## Supermarket

1. Variability:
- different speed of cashier workers
- different quantity of customers at different time of day
- changing demand for certain products (seasonal for example, or some “trendy” products as vegan)

2. Complexity:
- products have different storage requirements (diary and bread)
- products have  different shelf lives
- different type of products are sold in different sections (food, household chemicals
- different services the product goes through to reach the shelf.
- different type of business relationships: suppliers, customers, marketing

3. Interconnectedness:
- Time of product movement from suppliers to store shelf depends on supplier delivery, inventory tracking, quality inspection, and shelf placement
- fewer workers in the supermarket- slow service – less sales
- more  workers in the supermarket – faster and more efficient customer services- more sales, but higher labor costs must be considered for profitability.
